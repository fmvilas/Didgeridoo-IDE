					<h2>What is a library</h2>
					<p>
						Say library, say framework. We understand libraries as a collection of useful routines to help developer make things easier, faster and better.
					</p>
					<p>
						On Didgeridoo, libraries stands for enhancing. We are using jQuery as our default framework but not everybody uses the same libraries so you will want to include new libraries. Thus, we provide an easy way to incorporate them to the Didgeridoo ecosystem.  
					</p>
					
					<a id="why"></a>
					<h2>Why to separate</h2>
					<p>
						It's easy. Libraries are not Didgeridoo, it makes use of them. By separating, the users can use many different libraries, multiple versions of the same library and use the ones they like for their projects without conditioning them to choose between a few. 
					</p>

					<h2>How to define</h2>
					<p>
						<span class="label label-warning">IMPORTANT:</span> This is not the way the developer should add libraries, it is the description of how it should be done.
						<br><br>
						Telling Didgeridoo how to include a library is easy. You only have to create a new folder inside the <span class="label label-info">libraries</span> folder with the name of the library, copy the files there and add the library to the libraries.list.json. That's all.
						<br><br>
						After this you will be able to load the library.
