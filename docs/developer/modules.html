					<h2>What is a module</h2>
					<p>
						A module is a fully -or almost fully- functional program that not belongs to the Didgeridoo core but enhances the functionality of the system. Modules differs from Libraries in a few things:
						<ul>
							<li>A module is not a collection but an specific enhancement.</li>
							<li>Communication between the Core and the Modules, and between Modules, are not directly made but through the Facade. It provides a loose coupled system.</li>
							<li>Modules usually will make use of Libraries.</li>
						</ul>
