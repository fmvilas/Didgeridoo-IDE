##Important!
Please understand it was a one-man project and it's not well documented, has a lot of bugs (even known although not reported), maybe has features that will be removed and even has things that appears but doesn't work yet.

I'm in the process of cleaning and putting the code in order.

####Your help is more than welcome ;-)

##Installing
Please, have a look at the [guide placed in the **docs** branch](https://github.com/fmvilas/Didgeridoo-IDE/tree/docs).

##About
